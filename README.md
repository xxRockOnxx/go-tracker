# go-tracker

This is my personal alternative to tools like Hubstaff and Clockify as a solution to privacy and personal problem of being unable to log work correctly and starting/stopping the timer.

I can be as privacy-invasive as I want since it gets stored locally. This way, even if I forget to start or stop the timer, I can simply check the screenshot and my desktop activities.

This tool works by:

- saving screenshots of all displays by interval
- saving all active windows for more context and in case screenshot is not helpful
- saving inactivity period with prompt if still working
- prompting on what is the task being done at the moment by interval

The prompts are all optional and are friction-less to make it easy and avoid getting out of the zone.
